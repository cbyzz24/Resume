            <p class="bioText">I’ve had the privilege of building a career that merges my passion for finance with a deep commitment to helping others. My journey began with a fascination for economics and investing, which quickly grew into a dedicated pursuit of knowledge and expertise in these fields. 
            Today, as a Certified Financial Planner (CFP®) practitioner, I take a comprehensive approach to financial planning, helping clients navigate the complexities of their financial lives. By developing tailored strategies, I ensure that each client’s unique goals are met at every stage of life.
            The ability to make a meaningful impact on clients' financial well-being is both rewarding and motivating. I’m grateful for the opportunities I’ve had in this field and am excited about the continued growth and possibilities ahead as I work to help others achieve financial security and success.</p>
